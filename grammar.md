As its name suggests, Germanisch is a pan-Germanic language that draws on similarities between the three main blocks of modern Germanic languages: English, Scandinavian languages ​​and continental Germanic languages ​​(German-Dutch spectrum).

<a href="#pronunciation"><h2 id="pronunciation">Pronunciation</h2></a>

With the exception of lexical borrowings, Germanic words are accented on the first vowel of the root. In compound words, the main stress is on the first element.

```
“au” = ['aʊ]
“c” is pronounced [s] before e, i & y. Before “k”, it is [k]. “ch” = [tʃ]
“e” is [e] as the first of a word, stressed vowel or central vowel of a root. Otherwise it is [ə]. “ei” = [ej]
“g” is always [g]
“h” is [h], but inside a root after a vowel, it is [x]
“i” = [i] and “ie” = [i:]
“j” = [j]
“ng” = [ŋ]
“ou” = ['oʊ]
“s” = “s”, except between two vowels where it becomes [z]; however, “ss” is always [s]; “sch” = [ʃ]
“u” = [u]
“w” is pronounced between [w] and [v]
“y” = [aj]
```

The simple vowels a, o & u can carry an “umlaut” = ¨ (ä, ö & ü) and become [ɛ], [ø] and [y] respectively. Diphthongs and double vowels cannot have an umlaut, except “äu” = [œy]. A double vowel is long.

When endings are added, if the last vowel of the word before addition is an unstressed “e”, it may disappear.


<a href="#nouns"><h2 id="nouns">Nouns</h2></a>

Germanic has two genders: common ("utrum") and neuter ("ne-utrum"), determined arbitrarily and which must be learned with the noun. Only personal pronouns distinguish between masculine and feminine (for living beings). The singular definite article for the common is “den”, for the neuter “dat”; for both genders, the plural definite article is “de” = [də]. For both genders, the singular indefinite article is “en” = [ən].

The plural is determined as follows:

Nouns ending in -e are invariable; those ending in another vowel or a stressed -e add an -s.

Words of Latin origin ending in -um replace it with -a.

Otherwise, we try to put an umlaut on the first syllable (stressed, except prefix) of the root (in compound words, it is the last term which is concerned), and if this is impossible, we try on the following vowels, even unstressed from the root (not the suffixes!), and provided that the vowel is followed by at least one consonant.

> “nose”: nas > näs

> “body”: liham > lihäm

If this is not possible, words accented on the first vowel of the root and whose last vowel is an unstressed “e” before one or more consonants, use an -s:

> “finger”: finger > fingers

Other polysyllabic words designating an animate being with a common gender accented on the first vowel of the root and whose last vowel (before one or more consonants) is not “e” can use “-e”.

> “herring”: hering > heringe


Finally, nouns not falling into any of the previous categories are also invariable. This is particularly the case for borrowings which are not stressed on the first vowel of the word.

> “student”: studenten = [stu'dentən] (invariable)

Modern Germanic no longer has any declension, with the exception of the possible ending of genitive -s on noun, which can thus be applied, as in English or Scandinavian, to an entire noun group.


<a href="#adjectives"><h2 id="adjectives">Adjectives</h2></a>

The subject attribute adjectives and those in apposition are invariable. Likewise, adjectives ending in a vowel other than “e” or “y” are invariable in any position.

Epithet adjectives agree with their noun and are placed between the article (or pronoun) and the noun. If the article or pronoun is already marked in gender or number, the ending of the adjective is -e. Otherwise, in the singular, it is -en for common, -t for neuter, and -e for plural. Examples:

> “the blind man” = den blinde mann; “blind men” = de blinde männ

> “a blind man” = en blinden mann; “blind men” = blinde männ

> “the good country” = dat gude land; “the good countries” = from gude länd

> “a good country” = in gudt land; “good countries” = gude länd

The comparative is in -er... dan, and the superlative in -(e)st. If possible, the stressed vowel carries the umlaut.

Irregularities: “good” = gud/better/best, “bad” = ivel/wärs/wärst and “small” = litel/minder/minst

> Den grötst af jure frükt is jurn per, de minst grot jure kirsch = “The largest of your fruits is your pear, the smallest your cherries”

> Say wo hav arbeided mest andfo de dickste frükt; say wo hav arbeided fau andfo de minste frükt = “Those who have worked the hardest receive the largest fruits; those who have worked little receive the smallest fruits”

Adverbs correspond to the bare form of the adjective, except for wel = “good”, and ill = “bad”.

<a href="#personal-pronouns"><h2 id="personal-pronouns">Personal pronouns</h2></a>


|                            | Nominative | Oblique | Base of the possessive |
|----------------------------|-----------|---------|--------------------------|
| 1° person singular      | ik        | my      | my-                      |
| 2° person singular      | du        | dy      | dy-                      |
| 3° person singular masculine | hi    | him     | sy-                      |
| 3° person singular feminine | si     | her     | her-                     |
| 3° person singular common | den    | den     | sy-                      |
| 3° person neuter         | et        | et      | sy-                      |
| 1° person plural        | wi        | os      | or-                      |
| 2° person plural        | ie        | jer     | jur-                     |
| 3° person plural        | die       | dem     | der-                     |


“den” is used for common “asexual” nouns. “ie” is also used for polite “vouvoiement”. Dat can be used as a general pronoun (“it”). It is opposed to dis (“this”) which is also (with endings) the basis of the demonstrative pronoun/adjective.

The oblique corresponds to both the direct and indirect object, and when the pronoun comes after a preposition. The pronoun having a dative meaning precedes the accusative.

> Ik giv him et = “I give him that”

The thoughtful is sy. Otherwise, we can suffix selv to pronouns.

Gender endings (-[e]n, -t, -e) are added to the bases of possessive pronouns/adjectives which then function as a definite article.

> Den per is myn = “the pear is mine”


<a href="#relative-pronouns"><h2 id="relative-pronouns">Relative pronouns</h2></a>

The general relative pronoun is welch + ending = “which”

Otherwise: dat is used for the neuter singular, der for the common nominative singular. For any gender and number, and for animate beings, we can use wo in the nominative case and wem in the oblique case. Finally, the relative object complement can simply be omitted (as in English or Swedish) if it does not hinder understanding. “whose” = wes

Prepositions are suffixed to waar.


<a href="#verbs"><h2 id="verbs">Verbs</h2></a>

Unless the verb root already ends in a vowel, the infinitive ending is -e.

The imperative and the form of the verb in the present tense correspond to the bare form (without -e) except for rare irregularities which will be indicated. (mainly auxiliary verbs and modal verbs).

The preterite and the past participle of regular (“weak”) verbs are formed by adding -de/-d respectively to the verb root. If the last consonant is voiceless (f, k, p, s, sch), these endings are -te/-t. If the consonant cluster after the last vowel contains a dental (ch, d, t), both the preterite and past participle endings are -ed.

The ablaut of strong verbs whose root ends in a consonant can be grouped into several classes:

```
I: yC/iC:iV
IV: eC/aC/oC
```

Germanic has no future tense (it uses modals for that, or simply adverbs, or even the present tense if the meaning is obvious). On the other hand, it has a synthetic conditional which corresponds to the form of the preterite with if possible umlaut on the stressed vowel of the verbal root and addition of -e. The three irregular conditionals are “would” = wär, “should” = schoud, and “would” = woud

> Wen ik wär rich, käupte ik en haus = “If I were rich, I would buy a house”

Germanic can form a perfect with the verb have + past participle.

The ending of the present participle is -(e)nd.

Modern Germanic no longer uses person endings in the modern language. In an elevated style, it is -(e)st in the second person singular, -(e)n in all persons in the plural and, only for the present tense, -(e)t for the third person singular (but not for modals).

The verb to be = wese is very irregular: in the present tense: är except in the third person singular = is. In the past tense: was in the singular, war in the plural. The conditional is wär and the past participle wesen.

Modal verbs express nuances and are used with the infinitive not preceded by you. Their present is the old form which was only valid for the singular.

| Infinitif | Present | Past Tense | Past Participle | Conditional |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bedurve (to need) | bedarf | bedurft | bedurft | bedürfte |
| Döre (to dare) | dör | dörd | dörd | dörde |
| Kunne (can) | kann | kunnd | kunnd | künnde |
| Moge (to have the right) | mog | mohd | mohd | möhde |
| Muste (must) | must | muste | must | müste |
| Schulle (should) | schall | schuld | schuld | schould |
| Werde (to become) | werd | ward | urden | ürde |
| Wille (to want) | will | wilt | wilt | woud |
| Witte (to know) | weit | wist | wist | wiste |

With a past participle, werde corresponds to the French expression “se faire + infinitive” (transitive); with an infinitive, it expresses a probability in the future (in other tenses using the conditional)

<a href="#numbers"><h2 id="numbers">Numbers</h2></a>

Cardinals: “0” = null. Then, from 1 to 12: ein, two, drie, proud, femf, sex, seven, aht, nyn, ten, elve, twalv. From 13 to 19, the suffix is ​​-tien.

“20” is twunti. The other tens add -ti. “100” is hundred, “1000” tausend. The units come after the tens: 22 = twunti-two

“First” is först. The other ordinals add -de, but -te if the last consonant is voiceless, and -ste if the group of final consonants contains a dental.

<a href="#syntax"><h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2></a>

The adjective comes before the noun, except if it introduces a complement. 

> En interessant spraak = An interesting language

> En spraak interessant tu lere = A language interesting to learn

The recommended order of words is: 

```
Subject – Conjugated verb – Object – Adverb – Unconjugated verb – manner – place – time
```

For questions, there is an inversion of the subject and the verb.

Germanisch otherwise can highlight an important element by placing it in first position if this does not hinder understanding. If necessary, we try to keep the verb in second position. 

Negation comes after the conjugated verb and personal pronouns.

Examples:
<blockquote>
    <p>Ik les dat buk kwick in den skule disdag.<br>Ik les et kwick in den skule disdag.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p>Ik les <b>nit</b> dat buk kwick in den skule disdag.<br>Ik les et <b>nit</b> kwick in den skule disdag.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p>Ik hav dat buk lesen kwick in den skule disdag.<br>Ik hav et lesen kwick in den skule disdag.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p>Ik hav <b>nit</b> dat buk lesen kwick in den skule disdag.<br>Ik hav et <b>nit</b> lesen kwick in den skule disdag.</p>
</blockquote>

The Great Invasions (5th century) : 
The situation changed at the beginning of the 5th century. On the one hand, the Roman Empire was weakened, and its division into two, in 395, mainly led to the concentration of defense resources in the East, leaving the West relatively poorly protected. On the other side, serious events are taking place in unknown lands (nowadays Poland, Ukraine, Russia): coming from Central Asia, Turko-Mongol nomads, the Huns, are riding towards the west, bringing with them vanquished peoples. With a strange appearance and a reputation for ferocity, they caused real panic among the Germanic peoples who fled before them. An enormous chaos shakes the Germanic world and throws terrified peoples seeking refuge in the Empire towards the Roman border.<br>
During the winter of 406-407, the Rhine border was forced by the Vandals near Cologne. Goths, Franks, Suevi, Alemanni, Burgundians flock to Gaul in entire tribes, with women and children. Riding south into Italy, the Visigoth Alaric took and plundered Rome in 410. In 429, the Vandal Genseric reached North Africa and conquered what is now Algeria. In 441, the Angles and Saxons occupied Brittany (present-day England) and pushed back the Celtic natives; in the 6th century, many fled to Armorica, which they made into a little Brittany.

In all the territories of their conquests, the Romans had built numerous cities which were connected by a vast network of roads. The peoples of Europe were thus able to establish fruitful commercial exchanges facilitated by the fact that they were subject to the same laws and spoke the same language. This way of life was changed by the arrival of the Germans. They were mainly devoted to agriculture and most were not interested in the great stone cities that the Romans had built. They lived in villages with houses of wood and cob. Around these villages were fields of rye, wheat or barley, and enclosures for livestock. The Germans weaved sheep's wool to make clothing. Women wore long dresses and men short shirts over pants. Jeweled brooches were used to fasten the heavy wool or fur coats that completed these outfits.

Poème en suédois de J.Runeberg : 

När den sköna Maj med sippor kommit,
Kransa tärnor sina bruna lockar,
Skyndande till ringdans kring sin majstång.
Under dansen äro alla glada:
Glad är den, som bär ett vackert smycke,
Glad är den, hvars blomsterkrans är lyckad,
Glad är den, som känner kinden rodna.
Frågar du, hvem gladast är af alla?
Den, som ser sin fästman med i ringen.

Germanisch :
Kommen met anemone den schöne Mai
Mäid dere braune löck krans
Hastend tu den ringdans um den maimast
Alle ären glad in den dans
Glad is wo ber en smucken juvelen
Disen, wem hav lückt hern blümkrans is glad
Disen, wo fiel rodne wang heren
Wo is den glädst af alle, du frag ?
Disen, wo sie in den ring forlovd heren.
